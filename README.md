## Flix Part 1

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### App Walkthough GIF
`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walkthough `gif` in the image tag below, `YOUR_GIF_URL_HERE`. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (ðŸš« Remove this paragraph after after adding gif)

<img src="YOUR_GIF_URL_HERE" width=250><br>

### Notes
Most of this was fairly straightforward. The one place which I got briefly stuck at was getting the emulator to actually switch into the landscape view when rotating the phone.
After a few minutes I realized this wasn't an issue with my app at all, but that the orientation lock of the emulator phone must have been left enabled by default.
As I suspected, locating the "Auto-rotate screen" setting on the phone and enabling it fixed the issue and the app now works as expected.
