### Notes

At first the YouTube player was reporting that it encountered an error when trying to playback any videos. I realized that the video walkthrough seems to be missing
a section from the YouTubePlayerView guide which adds an additional piece to AndroidManifest.xml which provides compatibility for API versions of 30 or higher,
which is what my emulator happened to be using. After this plus a cold boot, the player was working fine.
