## Notes

Ran into several issues trying to match functionality from the demo video, but two stood out as particularly unexpected/frustrating. One was the Toast failing to
display for any discernible reason, which was eventually resolved by wiping the emulator device and cold-booting it. The other was the project imploding on itself
multiple times while trying to clean up and repurpose an older git repository, which admittedly wasn't part of the standard procedure but was taken care of by
some branch management to get only the relevant files back on master.
